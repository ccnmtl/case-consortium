This case traces the use of data in making wiser policy decisions, from the adoption by the New York Police Department in the 1990s of Compstat (computerized comparison crime statistics) to the 2013 implementation by the Fire Department of a computerized building inspection system. It ends in 2013, as the Bloomberg administration draws to a close, to ask whether data on city functions, services and residents should be centralized or kept specific to individual departments. Is there an optimal balance? What about citizen privacy issues? Should other cities imitate New York?
