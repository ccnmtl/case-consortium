## The Case Study

The heart of the Case Method is the “teaching” case study, so-called because it is used as a vehicle for classroom discussion. Most teaching cases are “decision forcing”&mdash;that is, the narrative stops at a critical turning point or decision point. The protagonist of a Journalism School case, for example, can be a reporter, editor, broadcast executive or publisher. Most often the protagonist is an individual, although a case can also profile a publication or news organization (or in other disciplines, an agency, a business or a government).

Sometimes, however, case studies are “retrospective.” They tell an entire story from start to finish and the classroom discussion focuses on identifying the decision points and exploring what options the protagonist had at any given point. While each of our cases includes an epilogue, it is not necessary to distribute the epilogue to students. Analytic and problem-solving learning can be all the more powerful when the “what happened” is left unanswered.

## The Case Method Classroom

In the Case Method classroom, students put themselves in the shoes of a protagonist facing a decision to which there is no “right answer.” Students are expected to analyze the situation, identify the problem and who "owns" it, prescribe a solution, defend their views, persuade their colleagues, and/or amend their own position in the face of new information or persuasive arguments from others. The vicarious real-world experience students gain in the case classroom will stand them in good stead when they become news industry leaders and managers in their own right.

The case classroom provides students with a non-threatening environment in which to practice newly forming habits of analysis, leadership and management. They will develop critical thinking and judgment skills. While an instructor will ensure a culture of respect for others, students will learn to probe, question and examine assumptions. Students are encouraged to bring their own experiences to bear as they debate, among themselves and with the instructor, how best to approach the dilemma at hand.
