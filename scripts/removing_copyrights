# steps to remove the copyright notices on the case pages

## some global search and replaces
```
cd ccnmtl-caseconsortium/casestudies
# remove the copyright paragraph on the abstract and case home page
# undef $/ since this is a multiline match
find . -name \*.html | xargs perl -pi -e "undef $/; s#<p>\s+Copyright\s+&copy;.*?</p>##sg"
# pick up a few more that have spans around them (the 0777 slurps in whole file, improving multiline matches)
find . -name \*html | xargs perl  -0777 -pi -e 'undef $/; s#<p>\s+\s+<span style="font-size:11px;">Copyright\s+&copy;.*?</p>##sg'

# remove the 2nd copyright notice in thefooter - leave a placeholder for CC replacement later
find . -name \*.html | xargs perl -pi -e "s#<a .*?20\d\d Columbia University.*?</a>#<!-- copyright notice -->#g"

unfortunately, many of these were hand tweaked, and I could not find a universal regex. I was able to find and remove a few stray ones like this:

find . -name \*html | xargs grep -r Copyright | grep -v '<!--' |
