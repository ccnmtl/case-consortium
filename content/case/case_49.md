This video-intensive case is about a Chilean TV news program's year-long effort to locate the nation's most-wanted criminal, and whether its investigation is properly journalistic or verges on police matters. Students will explore the fine line between legitimate and illegitimate use of undercover reporting techniques, including hidden cameras. They will also have a chance to weigh the costs of an investigative reporting project against its likely returns.
