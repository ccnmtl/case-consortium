These two stand-alone cases examine separate aspects of the hybrid print/online political news outlet *Politico*. In Part B, students take an in-depth look at the business model *Politico* adopted. They will be asked to imagine themselves in the shoes of journalism entrepreneurs deciding what formula will ensure sufficient revenue to continue operations.

*This case can be used alone, or in combination with <a href="/case/RiskyBusinessPartA/">Part A</a>. The two parts can be taught together, or in successive class sessions.*
