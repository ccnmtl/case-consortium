This case study examines how the media is both observer and participant in what are often characterized as “the culture wars”—ideological stand-offs in US society between conservative and liberal influence groups. In June 2005, the *Wall Street Journal* published an op-ed by recognized conservative voice Debra Burlingame, in which she levied charges against a proposed International Freedom Center (IFC) at the World Trade Center memorial site.
