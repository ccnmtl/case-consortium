This case explores the ethical and logistical challenges that face doctors when an infectious disease patient does not cooperate voluntarily with advice to stay out of public spaces in order to protect the general welfare. In April 2007, a young Atlanta lawyer, Andrew Speaker, was diagnosed with active tuberculosis. Initially cooperative, Speaker departs without notice for Greece and his scheduled wedding after it becomes clear that his strain of TB is more lethal and difficult-to-treat than anticipated.
