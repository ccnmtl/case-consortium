Some notes on the pdf watermark removal.

Our source files are a bit disorganized, and the only way to be sure what version of the file we are working with is to pull down the pdf in question.

First, collect the links to the pdf, teaching_note and epilogs

% cd case-consortium/scripts
% grep pdf\": ../content/case/case_* | cut -d\  -f2- | sed 's/\"//g' > case_pdfs.txt
