This sustainable development case focuses on the unintended consequences of disaster and development aid on indigenous societies, and raises for discussion whether a better model exists. In December 2004, a killer tsunami swept across the Indian Ocean, devastating among others the Nicobar Islands, a remote outpost of India. The indigenous Nicobarese had a coconut-based economy; the tsunami not only killed 25 percent of the islanders but felled the trees on which they depended. Aid&mdash;from food and water to cellphones, motorcycles, TVs and candy&mdash;poured in to the islands. To his dismay, longtime Nicobars anthropologist Simron Singh soon perceived that the islanders were losing initiative and self-reliance.
